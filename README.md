# WiZmote_Utils

wizmote_serial.ino runs on ESP8266 or ESP32

It receives ESP-NOW messages from 1 or more WiZmotes and passes a JSON message over serial to be received and processed by wizmote_serial.py

wizmote_serial.py allows for function callbacks for all remotes, or combinations of specific remotes and/or specific button presses.
